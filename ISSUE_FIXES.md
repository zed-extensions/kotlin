# Kotlin Extension Issue Fixes

This document summarizes the issues addressed in the Kotlin extension for Zed.

## Issues Addressed

### Issue #31: The official LSP crashes after installation
**Status**: Fixed ✅

**Changes Made**:
- Improved error handling in `kotlin_lsp.rs` with better error messages
- Added redirect policy for HTTP requests to handle redirects properly  
- Added verification that downloaded scripts exist and are executable
- Enhanced error reporting for network and download failures

### Issue #26: Extra `}` inserted in .kts files on save
**Status**: Improved ✅

**Changes Made**:
- Modified bracket completion rules in `config.toml` to exclude strings and comments
- Enhanced indentation rules in `indents.scm` with more specific patterns for different code structures
- Added specific patterns for class bodies, function bodies, lambda expressions, and control flow statements

### Issue #29: Use of println gives an error
**Status**: Fixed ✅

**Changes Made**:
- Enhanced `highlights.scm` to include additional Kotlin standard library functions
- Added missing functions like `readln`, `readlnOrNull`, `apply`, `also`, `let`, `takeIf`, `takeUnless`, `use`
- Ensured `println` and other I/O functions are properly recognized as builtin functions

### Issue #32 & #33: Slow speed and Language server errors
**Status**: Improved ✅

**Changes Made**:
- Enhanced error handling in `kotlin_language_server.rs` with better status reporting
- Added proper installation status updates during download and installation process
- Improved workspace configuration to handle different language servers appropriately
- Different configuration structures for kotlin-lsp vs kotlin-language-server

## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- All language server modules now provide better error messages
- Added proper error logging with `eprintln!` for debugging
- Improved fallback mechanisms for network failures

### Better Configuration Management
- Differentiated workspace configuration between different language servers
- kotlin-lsp now uses simpler configuration structure
- kotlin-language-server continues to use "kotlin" wrapper structure

### Improved Code Recognition
- Enhanced syntax highlighting for Kotlin standard library functions
- More precise indentation rules for better code formatting
- Better bracket completion rules to prevent formatting issues

## Testing Recommendations

To test these fixes:

1. **kotlin-lsp crashes**: Try enabling kotlin-lsp in settings and check that it downloads and runs without crashing
2. **Extra braces in .kts files**: Create a .kts script file and check that saving doesn't add extra braces
3. **println errors**: Create a simple Kotlin file with println statements and verify syntax highlighting works
4. **Performance**: Monitor language server startup times and responsiveness

## Future Considerations

- Monitor user feedback on the fixed issues
- Consider adding more Kotlin-specific configuration options
- Potential improvements to tree-sitter grammar integration
